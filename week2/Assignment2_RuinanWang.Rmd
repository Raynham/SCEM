```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## 1. Types of variables
### check the rows number and columns number of hawksSmall
```{r}
library(Stat2Data)
data("Hawks")
hawksSmall<-drop_na(select (Hawks,Age,Day,Month,Year,CaptureTime,Species,Wing,Weight,Tail))
dim(hawksSmall)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
